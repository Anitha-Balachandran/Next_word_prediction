# Next Word Prediction

## Project Overview
This project focuses on **Next Word Prediction** using **LSTM** and **GRU** models, leveraging Recurrent Neural Networks to predict the next word in a sequence. The primary objective is to demonstrate how deep learning techniques can effectively handle sequential text data and generate meaningful predictions.

## Dataset Used
The dataset is based on **Shakespeare's play "Hamlet"**, which provides a rich and complex text corpus. The text is preprocessed, tokenized, and prepared into sequences for training the models.

## Tools and Techniques Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Deep Learning Framework**: TensorFlow/Keras
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Tokenization, sequence generation, and padding
- **Optimization**:
  - Early Stopping to prevent overfitting
  - Comparison of LSTM and GRU architectures
- **Libraries**: NLTK, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
